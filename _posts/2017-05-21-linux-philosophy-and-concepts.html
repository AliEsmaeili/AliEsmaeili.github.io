  <h2>Linux Foundation</h2>
  <p>
    The Linux Foundation is home to Linux creator <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> and lead maintainer <strong>Greg Kroah-Hartman</strong>, and provides a neutral home where Linux kernel development can be protected and accelerated for years to come. The Linux Foundation is the umbrella organization for many critical open source projects that power corporations today, spanning all industry sectors. Its work today extends far beyond Linux, fostering innovation at every layer of the software stack.

  <h2>Linux Philosophy</h2>
  <p>Linux borrows heavily from the <strong>UNIX</strong> operating system because it was written to be a free and open source version of <strong>UNIX</strong>. Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, with the top node of the system being <em>root</em> or simply "<var>/</var>". Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects, and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files.</p>

  <p>Linux is a fully<strong> multitasking</strong> (i.e., multiple threads of execution are performed simultaneously), <strong>multiuser</strong> operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as <strong>daemons</strong> in the <strong>UNIX</strong> world.</p>

  <h2>Linux Terminology</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The <dfn>kernel</dfn> is considered the brain of the Linux operating system. It controls the hardware and makes the hardware interact with the applications.</li>
    <li>A <dfn>distribution</dfn> also known as Distros is a collection of programs for file-related operations, user management, software package management, etc. combined with the Linux kernel to make up a Linux-based operating system.</li>
    <li>The <dfn>boot loader</dfn>, as the name implies, is a program that boots the operating system. Two examples of a boot loader are GRUB and ISOLINUX.</li>
    <li>A <dfn>service</dfn> is a program that runs as a background process. Some examples of the service are httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd and named.</li>
    <li>A <dfn>filesystem</dfn> is a method for storing and organizing files in Linux. Some examples of filesystems are ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS and Btrfs.</li>
    <li>The <dfn>X Window System</dfn> provides the standard toolkit and protocol to build graphical user interfaces on nearly all Linux systems.</li>
    <li>The <dfn>desktop environment</dfn> is a graphical user interface on top of the operating system. GNOME, KDE, Xfce and Fluxbox are some examples of the desktop environment.</li>
    <li>  The <dfn>command line</dfn> is an interface for typing commands on top of the operating system.</li>
    <li>The <dfn>Shell</dfn> is the command line interpreter that interprets the command line input and instructs the operating system to perform any necessary tasks and commands. For example, bash, tcsh and zsh.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So we have <var>hardware</var>, <var>kernel</var> and <var>command line</var> with <var>shell</var> in order as <var>console</var> and next, <var>X window system(X11)</var>, <var>window manager</var> and <var>desktop environment</var> as <var>graphical user interface(gui)</var>.
